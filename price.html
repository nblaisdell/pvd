<h1>Pricing</h1>

<hr><br>

<h2>Initial website creation</h2>

<p><strong>Rate: $35 per hour ($45 for non-CS stuff)</strong><br>
  Flat fee of $100 for a newly created website. My hourly estimate for a new site in Wix is about 3-5 hours.
</p>

<p>Options:</p>
<p><strong>Option 1: Wix or Squarespace:</strong> I will design a site for you on either Wix or Squarespace. (I have a preference for Wix personally but either one works great.) <strong>Pros:</strong> Fast to create, high level of control, secure. <strong>Cons:</strong> A little higher hosting cost.
<p><strong>Option 2: Wordpress:</strong> I will find a Wordpress theme and set it up for you. <strong>Pros:</strong> cheaper hosting costs. <strong>Cons:</strong> Less control over elements of site depending on the theme, it needs to be upkept regularly to keep secure (which I can do, see below.)</p>
<p><strong>Option 3: HTML/CSS:</strong> I'll design a site in pure HTML/CSS if you really want me to for some reason. <strong>Pros:</strong> Extreme level of control, same hosting cost as Wordpress. <strong>Cons:</strong> It takes longer to code, not recommended.</p>

<br>

<h2>Retainer</h2>

<p><strong>Cost: $25 per month</strong><br>
  Keep me on retainer: meaning I will do 1 hour of work for free per month for you, as well as update your site on a regular basis if needed (aka Wordpress), and answer any questions you may have via either email or phone, and be available for emergancy support.
</p>

<p>Otherwise my regular price (currently $35 per hour) will apply to any time spent on your site.</p>
