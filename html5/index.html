  <h3>CREATING AND IMPROVING</h3>

  <p>Whether you already have a web presence or not, if you want to start over from scratch, or just update an existing site, I'll work with you to define and meet your goals.</p>
   
  <h3>KEEPING YOUR SITE UPDATED</h3>

  <p>If you want to learn how to easily edit your site once it's created, I'll teach you how easy it is, without even learning a line of code.</p>

  <p>Or, if you want me to keep it updated for you, I can do that too.</p>

  <h3>HELPING YOU OUTREACH</h3>

  <p>I can help you get found on Google with SEO; and if social media is something you're thinking about, I can help you figure out if it's worth it, and teach you to do it effectively.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>WHO AM I?</h2>

  <p>Just a guy who loves good design and Christian Science. I taught myself HTML and CSS right out of college and I've had a circuitous career with freelance web work on and off since then. Right now I saw a need I thought I could fill, so here I am!</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>PORTFOLIO</h2>

  <p>My work has involved doing complete redesigns to sites (such as third Seattle or First Princeton) or sproucing up, adding content, and keeping updated sites like (healingdfw and comforter's calling). Whatever your needs are, I can work with you to achieve them.</p>
